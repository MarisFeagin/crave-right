Crave Right is a Nutrition-based Navigator service that helps you find the best restuarants, grocery stores, and local businesses according to your dietary and allergy needs.

## Features
- Crave Right features a custom filter system with the help of the Overpass API to locate businesses that best match user preferences in their local area.
- The filter inculdes a vast range of diets, allergens, cultural cuisine, price range, calorie range, and more!
- Location Markers contain pages on individual businesses with a list of dietary and allergen options, an in-house online ordering menu for select businesses and contact information.

## Stretch Goals
- Online Ordering system with detailed nutrition information tha lists relevant allergies, diets, calories, macros, and ingredients for each menu item.
- Users can login to save their prefrences, leave reviews, and favorite locations.
- Users can rate businesses on variety, hospitality, taste, atmosphere, and which diets and allergies are most welcome.

## Mission
Often businesses do not display how their food is cooked in the most accessible manner. So our goal is for those partaking in the wonderful world of take-out or sit-down dining to understand what they fuel themselves with to prevent future guilt in the restroom or allergic out breaks.
